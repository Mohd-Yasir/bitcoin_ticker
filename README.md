# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## Goal
The objective of this project is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.

### What I will create
I am going to make a crypto currency price checking app. With this app you'll be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move!

## What I learned
- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in my app.
- How to check the platform my app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
